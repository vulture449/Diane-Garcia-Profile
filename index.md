My name is Diane Garcia, and I am a student at Northern Illinois University.

I love to code and I love math!

### Background

I was born in Waukegan, Illinois, and joined the NIU family when I was in my freshman year. I am the first one in my family that is going to a university!

Before coming to NIU, I used to play the cello since I was kid all the way to my freshman year in high school. I love playing video games as well as making some!
